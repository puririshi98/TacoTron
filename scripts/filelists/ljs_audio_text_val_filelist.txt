LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0179.wav|Based on its experience during this period, the Secret Service now recommends that additional personnel be made available to PRS
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0180.wav|so that these arrangements can be made permanent without adversely affecting the operations of the Service's field offices.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0181.wav|The Commission regards this as a most useful innovation and urges that the practice be continued.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0182.wav|Liaison With Local Law Enforcement Agencies
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0183.wav|Advice by the Secret Service to local police in metropolitan areas relating to the assistance expected in connection with a Presidential visit
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0184.wav|has hitherto been handled on an informal basis.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0185.wav|The Service should consider preparing formal explanations of the cooperation anticipated during a Presidential visit to a city,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0186.wav|in formats that can be communicated to each level of local authorities.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0187.wav|Thus, the local chief of police could be given a master plan, prepared for the occasion, of all protective measures to be taken during the visit;
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0188.wav|each patrolman might be given a prepared booklet of instructions explaining what is expected of him. The Secret Service has expressed concern
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0189.wav|that written instructions might come into the hands of local newspapers, to the prejudice of the precautions described.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0190.wav|However, the instructions must be communicated to the local police in any event and can be leaked to the press whether or not they are in writing.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0191.wav|More importantly, the lack of carefully prepared and carefully transmitted instructions for typical visits to cities
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0192.wav|can lead to lapses in protection, such as the confusion in Dallas about whether members of the public were permitted on overpasses.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0193.wav|Such instructions will not fit all circumstances, of course,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0194.wav|and should not be relied upon to the detriment of the imaginative application of judgment in special cases.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0195.wav|Inspection of Buildings
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0196.wav|Since the assassination of President Kennedy, the Secret Service has been experimenting with new techniques in the inspection of buildings along a motorcade route.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0197.wav|According to Secretary Dillon,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0198.wav|the studies indicate that there is some utility in attempting to designate certain buildings as involving a higher risk than others.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0199.wav|The Commission strongly encourages these efforts to improve protection along a motorcade route.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0200.wav|The Secret Service should utilize the personnel of other Federal law enforcement offices
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0201.wav|in the locality to assure adequate manpower for this task, as it is now doing.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0202.wav|Lack of adequate resources is an unacceptable excuse for failing to improve advance precautions
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0203.wav|in this crucial area of Presidential protection.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0204.wav|Secret Service Personnel and Facilities
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0205.wav|Testimony and other evidence before the Commission
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0206.wav|suggest that the Secret Service is trying to accomplish its job with too few people and without adequate modern equipment.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0207.wav|Although Chief Rowley does not complain about the pay scale for Secret Service agents,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0208.wav|salaries are below those of the FBI and leading municipal police forces.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0209.wav|The assistant to the Director of the FBI testified that
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0210.wav|the caseload of each FBI agent averaged twenty to twenty-five, and he felt that this was high.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0211.wav|Chief Rowley testified that the present workload of each Secret Service agent averages one hundred ten point one cases.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0212.wav|While these statistics relate to the activities of Secret Service agents stationed in field offices and not the White House detail,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0213.wav|field agents supplement those on the detail, particularly when the President is traveling.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0214.wav|Although the Commission does not know whether the cases involved are entirely comparable,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0215.wav|these figures suggest that the agents of the Secret Service are substantially overworked.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0216.wav|In its budget request for the fiscal year beginning July one, nineteen sixty-four,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0217.wav|the Secret Service sought funds for twenty-five new positions, primarily in field offices. This increase has been approved by the Congress.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0218.wav|Chief Rowley explained that this would not provide enough additional manpower to take all the measures which he considers required.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0219.wav|However, the nineteen sixty-four to sixty-five budget request was submitted in November nineteen sixty-three
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0220.wav|and requests for additional personnel were not made because of the studies then being conducted.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0221.wav|The Secret Service has now presented its recommendations to the Bureau of the Budget. The plan proposed by the Service
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0222.wav|would take approximately twenty months to implement and require expenditures of approximately three million dollars during that period.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0223.wav|The plan provides for an additional two hundred five agents for the Secret Service. Seventeen of this number are proposed for the Protective Research Section;
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0224.wav|one hundred forty-five are proposed for the field offices to handle the increased volume of security investigations
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0225.wav|and be available to protect the President or Vice President when they travel;
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0226.wav|eighteen agents are proposed for a rotating pool which will go through an intensive training cycle and also be available to supplement the White House detail
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0227.wav|in case of unexpected need; and twenty-five additional agents are recommended to provide the Vice President full protection.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0228.wav|The Commission urges that the Bureau of the Budget review these recommendations with the Secret Service and authorize a request for the necessary supplemental appropriation,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0229.wav|as soon as it can be justified. The Congress has often stressed that it will support any reasonable request for funds for the protection of the President.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0230.wav|Manpower and Technical Assistance From Other Agencies
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0231.wav|Before the assassination the Secret Service infrequently requested other Federal law enforcement agencies to provide personnel
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0232.wav|to assist in its protection functions.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0233.wav|Since the assassination, the Service has experimented with the use of agents borrowed for short periods from such agencies.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0234.wav|It has used other Treasury law enforcement agents on special experiments in building and route surveys in places to which the President frequently travels.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0235.wav|It has also used other Federal law enforcement agents during Presidential visits to cities in which such agents are stationed.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0236.wav|Thus, in the four months following the assassination,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0237.wav|the FBI, on sixteen separate occasions, supplied a total of one hundred thirty-nine agents to assist in protection work during a Presidential visit,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0238.wav|which represents a departure from its prior practice.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0239.wav|From February eleven through June thirty, nineteen sixty-four,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0240.wav|the Service had the advantage of nine thousand, five hundred hours of work by other enforcement agencies.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0241.wav|The FBI has indicated that it is willing to continue to make such assistance available,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0242.wav|even though it agrees with the Secret Service that it is preferable for the Service to have enough agents to handle all protective demands.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0243.wav|The Commission endorses these efforts to supplement the Service's own personnel by obtaining, for short periods of time,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0244.wav|the assistance of trained Federal law enforcement officers.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0245.wav|In view of the ever-increasing mobility of American Presidents, it seems unlikely that the Service could or should increase its own staff to a size
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0246.wav|which would permit it to provide adequate protective manpower for all situations.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0247.wav|The Commission recommends that the agencies involved determine how much periodic assistance they can provide, and that each such agency
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0248.wav|and the Secret Service enter into a formal agreement defining such arrangements.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0249.wav|It may eventually be desirable to codify the practice in an Executive order.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0250.wav|The Secret Service will be better able to plan its own long-range personnel requirements if it knows with reasonable certainty
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0251.wav|the amount of assistance that it can expect from other agencies.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0252.wav|The occasional use of personnel from other Federal agencies to assist in protecting the President has a further advantage. It symbolizes the reality
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0253.wav|that the job of protecting the President has not been and cannot be exclusively the responsibility of the Secret Service.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0254.wav|The Secret Service in the past has sometimes guarded its right to be acknowledged as the sole protector of the Chief Executive.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0255.wav|This no longer appears to be the case.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0256.wav|Protecting the President is a difficult and complex task which requires full use of the best resources of many parts of our Government.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0257.wav|Recognition that the responsibility must be shared increases the likelihood that it will be met.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0258.wav|Much of the Secret Service work requires the development and use of highly sophisticated equipment,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0259.wav|some of which must be specially designed to fit unique requirements. Even before the assassination, and to a far greater extent thereafter,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0260.wav|the Secret Service has been receiving full cooperation in scientific research and technological development
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0261.wav|from many Government agencies including the Department of Defense and the President's Office of Science and Technology.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0262.wav|Even if the manpower and technological resources of the Secret Service are adequately augmented,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0263.wav|it will continue to rely in many respects upon the greater resources of the Office of Science and Technology and other agencies.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0264.wav|The Commission recommends that the present arrangements
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0265.wav|with the Office of Science and Technology and the other Federal agencies that have been so helpful to the Secret Service be placed on a permanent and formal basis.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0266.wav|The exchange of letters dated August thirty-one, nineteen sixty-four,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0267.wav|between Secretary Dillon and Donald F. Hornig, Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, is a useful effort in the right direction.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0268.wav|The Service should negotiate a memorandum of understanding with each agency that has been assisting it and from which it can expect to need help in the future.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0269.wav|The essential terms of such memoranda might well be embodied in an Executive order.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0270.wav|This Commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection of our Presidents which will guarantee security.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0271.wav|The demands on the President in the execution of His responsibilities in today's world are so varied and complex
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0272.wav|and the traditions of the office in a democracy such as ours are so deep-seated as to preclude absolute security.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0273.wav|The Commission has, however, from its examination of the facts of President Kennedy's assassination
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0274.wav|made certain recommendations which it believes would, if adopted,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0275.wav|materially improve upon the procedures in effect at the time of President Kennedy's assassination and result in a substantial lessening of the danger.
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0276.wav|As has been pointed out, the Commission has not resolved all the proposals which could be made. The Commission nevertheless is confident that,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0277.wav|with the active cooperation of the responsible agencies and with the understanding of the people of the United States in their demands upon their President,
LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0278.wav|the recommendations we have here suggested would greatly advance the security of the office without any impairment of our fundamental liberties.
